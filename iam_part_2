IAM Security Tools
- IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
  - a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials
- IAM Access Advisor (user-level)
  - Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed
  - You can use this information to revise your policies






IAM Guidelines & Best Practices
- Don't use the root account except for AWS account setup
- One physical user = One AWS user
- Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
- Create a strong password policy
- Use and enforce the use of Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Create and use Roles for giving permissions to AWS services
- Use Access Keys for Programmatic Access (CLI/SDK)
- Audit permissions of your account using IAM Credentials Report & IAM Access Advisor
- Never share IAM users & Access Keys
