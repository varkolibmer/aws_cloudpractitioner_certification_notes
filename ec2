EC2 User Data
- It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script
- bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
- That script is only run once at the instance first start
- EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
  - Installing updates
  - Installing software
  - Downloading common files from the internet
  - Anything you can think of
- The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user





EC2 Instance Types: General Purpose
- Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
- Balance between:
  - Compute
  - Memory
  - Networking



EC2 Instance Types: Compute Optimized
- Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors:
  - Batch processing workloads
  - Media transcoding
  - High performance web servers
  - High performance computing (HPC)
  - Scientific modeling & machine learning
  - Dedicated gaming servers



EC2 Instance Types: Memory Optimized
- Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
- Use cases:
  - High performance, relational/non-relational databases
  - Distributed web scale cache stores
  - In-memory databases optimized for BI
  - Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data



EC2 Instance Types: Storage Optimized
- Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
- Use cases:
  - High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
  - Relational & NoSQL databases
  - Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
  - Data warehousing applications
  - Distributed file systems
