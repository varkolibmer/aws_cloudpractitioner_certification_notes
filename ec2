EC2 User Data
- It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script
- bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
- That script is only run once at the instance first start
- EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
  - Installing updates
  - Installing software
  - Downloading common files from the internet
  - Anything you can think of
- The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user





EC2 Instance Types: General Purpose
- Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
- Balance between:
  - Compute
  - Memory
  - Networking



EC2 Instance Types: Compute Optimized
- Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors:
  - Batch processing workloads
  - Media transcoding
  - High performance web servers
  - High performance computing (HPC)
  - Scientific modeling & machine learning
  - Dedicated gaming servers



EC2 Instance Types: Memory Optimized
- Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
- Use cases:
  - High performance, relational/non-relational databases
  - Distributed web scale cache stores
  - In-memory databases optimized for BI
  - Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data



EC2 Instance Types: Storage Optimized
- Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
- Use cases:
  - High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
  - Relational & NoSQL databases
  - Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
  - Data warehousing applications
  - Distributed file systems




EC2 Purchase Options:
- On-Demand Instances: short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
- Reserved (1 & 3 years)
  - Reserved Instances: long workloads
  - Convertible Reserved Instances: long workloads with flexible instances
- Savings Plan (1 & 3 years): commitment to an amount of usage, long workload
- Spot Instances: short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)
- Dedicated Hosts: book an entire physical server, control instance placement
- Capacity Reservations: reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration




EC2 On-Demand:
- Pay for what you use:
  - Linux or Windows: billing per second, after the first minute
  - All other operating systems: billing per hour
- Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
- No long-term commitment
- Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can't predict how the application will behave



EC2 Spot Instances:
- Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-Demand
- Instances that you can "lose" at any point of time if your max price is less than the current spot price
- The MOST cost-efficient instances in AWS
- Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure
  - Batch jobs
  - Data analysis
  - Image processing
  - Any distributed workload
  - Workloads with a flexible start and end time
- Not suitable for critical jobs or databases




EC2 Dedicated Hosts
- A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use
- Allows you address compliance requirements and use your existing server-bound software licenses (per-socket, per-core, pe-VM software licenses)
- Purchasing Options:
  - On-demand: pay per second for active Dedicated Host
  - Reserved: 1 or 3 years (No Upfront, Partial Upfront, All Upfront)
- The most expensive option
- Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (Bring Your Own License)
- Or for companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs



EC2 Dedicated Instances
- Instances run on hardware that's dedicated to you
- May share hardware with other instances in same account
- No control over instance placement (can move hardware after Start/Stop)



EC2 Capacity Reservations
- Reserve On-Demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
- You always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it
- No time commitment (create/cancel anytime), no billing discounts
- Combine with Regional Reserved Instances and Savings Plans to benefit from billing discounts
- You're charged at On-Demand rate whether you run instances or not
- Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in a specific AZ
