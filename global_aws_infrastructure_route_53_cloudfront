Global AWS Infrastructure
- Regions: For deploying applications and infrastructure
- Availability Zones: Made up of multiple data centers
- Edge Locations (Points of Presence): for content delivery as close to possible to users
- Global DNS: Route 53
  - Great to route users to the closest deployment with least latency
  - Great for disaster recovery strategies
- Global Content Delivery Network (CDN): CloudFront
  - Replicate part of your application to AWS Edge Locations - decrease latency
  - Cache common requests - improved user experience and decreased latency
- S3 Transfer Acceleration
  - Accelerate global uploads & downloads into Amazon S3
- AWS Global Accelerator:
  - Improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global network


Route 53
- Route 53 is a managed DNS (Domain Name System)
- DNS is a collection of rules and records which helps clients understand how to reach a server through URLs


Route 53 Routing Policies
- Need to know them at high level for the exam
- *Simple Routing Policy
- *Weighted Routing Policy


AWS CloudFront
- Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- Improves read performance, content is cached at the edge
- Improves user experience
- 216 points of presence globally (edge locations)
- DDoS Protection (because worldwide), integration with Shield, AWS Web Application Firewall

CloudFront - Origins
- S3 bucket
  - For distributing files and caching them at the edge
  - Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC)
  - OAC is replacing Origin Access Identity (OAI)
  - CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3)
- Custom Origin (HTTP)
  - Application Load Balancer
  - EC2 Instance
  - S3 website (must first enable the bucket as a static S3 Website)
  - Any HTTP backend you want


CloudFront vs. S3 Cross Region Replication
- CloudFront:
  - Global Edge network
  - Files are cached for a TTL (maybe a day)
  - Great for static content that must be available everywhere
- S3 Cross Region Replication:
  - Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
  - Files are updated in near real-time
  - Read only
  - Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions
