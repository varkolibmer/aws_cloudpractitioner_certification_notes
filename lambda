EC2 vs. Lambda
- EC2
  - Virtual Servers in the Cloud
  - Limited by RAM and CPU
  - Continuously running
  - Scaling means intervention to add/remove servers
- Lambda
  - Virtual Functions - no servers to manage!
  - Limited by time - short executions
  - Run on-demand
  - Scaling is automated!



Benefits of AWS Lambda
- Easy Pricing:
  - Pay per request and compute time
  - Free tier of 1,000,000 AWS Lambda requests and 400,000 GBs of compute time
- Integrated with the whole AWS suite of services
- Event-Driven: functions get invoked by AWS when needed
- Integrated with many programming languages
- Easy monitoring through AWS CloudWatch
- Easy to get more resources per functions (up to 10GB of RAM!)
- Increasing RAM will also improve CPU and network!



AWS Lambda Language Support
- Node.js
- Python
- Java (Java 8 compatible)
- C# (.NET Core)
- Golang
- C#/Powershell
- Ruby
- Custom Runtime API (community supported, example Rust)
- Lambda Container Image
  - The container image must implement the Lambda Runtime API
  - ECS/Fargate is preferred for running arbitrary Docker images
