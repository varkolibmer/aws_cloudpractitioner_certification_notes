**AWS Systems Manager
- Helps you manage your EC2 and On-Premise systems at scale
- Another Hybrid AWS service
- Get operational insights about the state of your infrastructure
- Suite of 10+ products
- Most important features are:
  - Patching automation for enhanced compliance
  - Run commands across an entire fleet of servers
  - Store parameter configuration with the SSM Parameter Store
- Works for Linux, Windows, MacOS, and Raspberry Pi OS


**How SSM works
- We need to install the SSM agent onto the systems we control
- Installed by default on Amazon Linux AMI & some Ubuntu AMI
- If an instance can't be controlled with SSM, it's probably an issue with the SSM agent!
- Thanks to the SSM agent, we can run commands, patch & configure our servers


AWS OpsWork
- Chef & Puppet help you perform server configuration automatically, or repetitive actions
- They work great with EC2 & On-Premise VM
- AWS OpsWork = Managed Chef & Puppet
- It's an alternative to AWS SSM
- Only provision standard AWS resources:
  - EC2 Instances, Databases, Load Balancers, EBS volumes...
- * In the exam: Chef or Puppet needed => AWS OpsWorks
