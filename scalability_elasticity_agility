- Scalability: ability to accomodate a larger load by making the hardware stronger (scale up), or by adding nodes (scale out)
- Elasticity: once a system is scalable, elasticity means that there will be some "auto-scaling" so that the system can scale based on the load. This is "cloud-friendly": pay-per-use, match demand, optimize costs
- Agility: new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes
