- An Elastic Load Balancer is a managed load balancer
  - AWS guarantees that it will be working
  - AWS takes care of upgrades, maintainance, high availability
  - AWS provides only a few configuration knobs
- It costs less to setup your own load balancer but it will be a lot more effort on your end (maintenance, integrations)
- 4 kinds of load balancers offered by AWS:
  - Application Load Balancer (HTTP/HTTPS only) - Layer 7
  - Network Load Balancer (ultra-high performance, allows for TCP) - Layer 4
  - Gateway Load Balancer - Layer 3
  - Classic Load Balancer - Layer 4 & 7
