EventBridge
- Schedule: Cron jobs (scheduled scripts)
- Event Pattern: Event rules to react to a service doing something
- Trigger Lambda functions, send SNS/SQS messages...
- Schema Registry: model event schema
- You can archive events (all/filter) sent to an event bus (indefinitely or set period)
- Ability to replay archived events


CloudTrail
- Provides governance, compliance and audit for your AWS account
- CloudTrail is enabled by default
- Get a history of events/API calls made within your AWS Account by
  - Console
  - SDK
  - CLI
  - AWS Services
- Can put logs from CloudTrail into CloudWatch Logs or S3
- A trail can be applied to All Regions (default) or a Single Region
- If a resource is deleted in AWS, investigate CloudTrail first!


X-Ray
- Debugging in production:
  - Test locally
  - Add log statements everywhere
  - Re-deploy in production
- Log formats differ across applications and log analysis is hard
- Debugging: one big monolith 'easy,' distributed services 'hard'
- No common views of your entire architecture


X-Ray Advantages
- Troubleshooting performance (bottlenecks)
- Understand dependencies in a microservice architecture
- Pinpoint service issues
- Review request behavior
- Find errors and exceptions
- Are we meeting time SLA?
- Where am I throttled?
- Identify users that are throttled
