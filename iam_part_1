- IAM = Identity and Access Management
- This is a GLOBAL SERVICE
- Root account created by default, shouldn't be used or shared
- Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
- Groups only contain users, not other groups
- Users don't have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups




IAM: Permissions
- Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
- These policies define the permissions of the users
- In AWS you apply the least privilege principle: don't give more permissions than a user needs




IAM Policies Structure
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",                            //Policy language version, always include "2012-10-17"
  "Id": "S3-Account-Permissions",                     //Id: an identifier for the policy (optional)
  "Statement": [                                      //Statement: one or more individual statements (required
    {
      "Sid": "1",                                     //Sid: an identifier for the statement (optional)
      "Effect": "Allow",                              //Effect: whether the statement allows or denies access (Allow, Deny)
      "Principal": {                                  //Principal: account/user/role to which this policy applied to
        "AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"]
      },
      "Action": [                                     //Action: list of actions this policy allows or denies
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*"]         //Resource: list of resources to which the actions applied to
    }
  ]
}                                                     //Condition: conditions for when this policy is in effect (optional)
