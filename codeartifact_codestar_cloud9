AWS CodeArtifact
- Software packages depend on each other to be built (also called code dependencies), and new ones are created
- Storing and retrieving these dependencies is called artifact management
- Traditionally you need to setup your own artifact management system
- CodeArtifact is a secure, scalable, and cost-effective artifact management for software development
- Works with common dependency management tools such as Maven, Gradle, npm, yarn, twine, pip, and NuGet
- Developers and CodeBuild can then retrieve dependencies straight from CodeArtifact
