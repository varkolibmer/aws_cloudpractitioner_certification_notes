Amazon SNS
- The "event publishers" only send messages to one SNS topic

Amazon MQ
- SQS, SNS are "cloud-native" services: proprietary protocols from AWS
- Traditional applications running from on-premises may use open protocols such as: MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS
- When migrating to the cloud, instead of re-engineering the application to use SQS and SNS, we can use Amazon MQ
- Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for
  - RabbitMQ
  - ActiveMQ
- Amazon MQ doesn't scale as much as SQS/SNS
- Amazon MQ runs on servers, can run in Multi-AZ with failover
- Amazon MQ has both queue features (~SQS) and topic features (~SNS)
