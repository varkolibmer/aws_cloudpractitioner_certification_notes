EC2 Instance Store
- EBS volumes are network drives with good but "limited" performance
- If you need a high-performance hardware disk, use EC2 Instance Store
- Better I/O performance
- EC2 Instance Store lose their storage if they're stopped (ephemeral)
- Good for buffer/cache/scratch data/temporary content
- Risk of data loss if hardware fails
- Backups and Replication are your responsibility
