EC2 Instance Store
- EBS volumes are network drives with good but "limited" performance
- If you need a high-performance hardware disk, use EC2 Instance Store
- Better I/O performance
- EC2 Instance Store lose their storage if they're stopped (ephemeral)
- Good for buffer/cache/scratch data/temporary content
- Risk of data loss if hardware fails
- Backups and Replication are your responsibility




Shared Responsibility Model for EC2 Storage
- AWS

  - Replacing faulty hardware
  - Ensuring their employees cannot access your data
- User
  - Setting up backup / snapshot procedures
  - Setting up data encryption
