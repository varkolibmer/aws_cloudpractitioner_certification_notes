EBS Volume
- An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run
- It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination
- They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the CCP level)
- They are bound to a specific availability zone
- Free tier: 30 GB of free EBS storage of type General Purpose (SSD) or Magnetic per month
- It's a network drive (i.e. not a physical drive)
  - It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency
  - It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly
- It's locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
  - An EBS Volume in us-east-la cannot be attached to us-east-lb
  - To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it
- Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPS)
  - You get billed for all the provisioned capacity
  - You can increase the capacity of the drive over time





EBS Snapshot
- Make a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time
- Not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended
- Can copy snapshots across AZ or region



EBS Snapshot Archive
- Move a Snapshot to an "archive tier" that is 75% cheaper
- Takes within 24 to 72 hours for restoring the archive



Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots
- Setup rules to retain deleted snapshots so you can recover them after an accidental deletion
- Specify retention (from 1 day to 1 year)
