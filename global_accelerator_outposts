AWS Global Accelerator
- Improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global network
- Leverage the AWS internal network to optimize the route to your application (60% improvement)
- 2 Anycast IP are created for your application and traffic is sent through Edge Locations
- The Edge locations send the traffic to your application


AWS Global Accelerator vs. CloudFront
- They both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world
- Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection
- CloudFront: Content Delivery Network
  - Improves performance for your cacheable content (such as images and videos)
  - Content is served at the edge
- Global Accelerator
  - No caching, proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions
  - Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
  - Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses
  - Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover



AWS Outposts
- Hybrid Cloud: businesses that keep an on-premise infrastructure alongside a cloud infrastructure
- Therefore, two ways of dealing with IT systems:
  - One for the AWS cloud (using the AWS console, CLI, and AWS APIs)
  - One for their on-premise infrastructure
- AWS Outposts are "server racks" that offers the same AWS infrastructure, services, APIs & tools to build your own applications on-premises just as in the cloud
- AWS will setup and manage "Outposts Racks" within your on-premises infrastructure and you can start leveraging AWS services on-premises
- You are responsible for the Outposts Rack physical security

- Benefits:
  - Low-latency access to on-premise systems
  - Local data processing
  - Data residency
  - Easier migration from on-premise to the cloud
  - Fully managed service
- Some services that work on Outposts:
  - Amazon EC2
  - Amazon EBS
  - Amazon S3
  - Amazon EKS
  - Amazon ECS
  - Amazon RDS
  - Amazon EMR
